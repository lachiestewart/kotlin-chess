# Kotlin Chess Game
Welcome to my Kotlin Chess Game, a basic implementation of the classic game of chess. This project marks my first time working with Kotlin and serves as a learning project for both Kotlin and JavaFX.

## Features
- Play a standard game of chess between two players.
- Implemented chess piece movement based on a strategy pattern.
- Basic user interface built using JavaFX.
- Visual representation of the chessboard and pieces.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin: This project is built using Kotlin, leveraging object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
- JavaFX: The user interface (UI) is created using JavaFX for rendering the chessboard and pieces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- JDK: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
- Kotlin: Kotlin Compiler (or use IntelliJ IDEA, which has built-in support for Kotlin).
- JavaFX SDK: Ensure that JavaFX is correctly set up in your development environment.

### Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/lachiestewart/kotlin-chess.git
```
2.Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Kotlin-compatible IDE.
3. Configure JavaFX by adding the JavaFX SDK to your project.
4. Run the project from your IDE.

### Usage
Once the game is running, you can start a two-player chess game:
- Click on a piece to select it.
- The UI will highlight valid moves.
- Make a move by clicking on a valid square.

## Project Structure
- src/org/example/main/kotlin: Contains the main Kotlin source code, including the game logic and piece movement strategies.
- src/org/example/main/resources: Contains UI-related resources (e.g., FXML files, images).

## Future Improvements
- Add AI for single-player mode.
- Implement move validation (e.g., check, checkmate, stalemate).
- Improve UI with additional game controls (e.g., restart, undo moves).
- Enhance visuals with custom themes or piece sets.
